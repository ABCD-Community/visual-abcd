# Visual ABCD

### This repository has 2 goals:

*   To explain how the ABCD layout is built by making information available for contributors who wish to incorporate modules into the Central system;
*   To provide basic classes for developers and database managers to help them apply visual improvements to their display formats.

## Levels and Layers

The logic of the ABCD layout is based on lines. Being from top to bottom:

*   Header - where information and actions concerning the system are located;
*   Module action line - Global information and actions concerning the screen in use;
*   Screen action line - where the toolbar is, if needed.
*   Action screen - where the operation and display of the activity being done actually takes place
*   Footer - Version information, useful links and community seal.
